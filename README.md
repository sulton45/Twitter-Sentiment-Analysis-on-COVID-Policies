The Indonesian government has implemented various measures to prevent the further spread of the COVID-19 virus by issuing policies. However, these government policies in handling COVID-19 have received mixed reactions from the Indonesian society. The society often expresses their comments on the government's policies in managing the COVID-19 virus through social media, particularly Twitter. The comments from the public, whether positive, neutral, or negative, towards the government's policies can be analyzed using sentiment analysis. This analysis employs two methods: Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes with Laplace Estimator. The objective of this research is to compare the accuracy levels of the two methods. The research findings indicate that the Support Vector Machine achieved an accuracy of 86%, while Naive Bayes with Laplace Estimator achieved an accuracy of 85% using a sample size of 2194 data points.
